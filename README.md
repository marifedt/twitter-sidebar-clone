# Twitter Sidebar Clone 

This project aims to improve my understanding of React

Components I created:
1. Sidebar - the contents of the sidebar are flexible
2. Button
	- Contains an event handler for click (I recently learned it so I tried)



## Things to do

- [ ] Make it responsive
	- Text should disappear when width of the screen is much smaller
- [ ] Create the profile component


### Notes:

- Fontawesome was used for the icons

On Sidebar.css: 
```
.Sidebar{
	width: max-content
}
```
> This is not supported on Internet Explorer
